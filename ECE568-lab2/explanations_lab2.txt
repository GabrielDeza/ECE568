In this lab, we followed the tutorial on OpenSSL programming
(http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4822) using SSL to secure the communication
between server and client.

Communication logic
Before:
client open socket
-> client send data
-> server receive data
-> server reply to client

After:
client initialize ssl context
-> create ssl socket using ssl context and original socket
-> check certificate of server
-> send data using SSL_write

-> server create ssl socket using ssl context to communicate with client
-> check certificate of client
-> reply to client using SSL_write

If the certificate of either client or server is invalid, corresponding errors
will be reported to either client or server.
